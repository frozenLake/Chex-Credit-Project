"Hi, everybody!"
"Hey, guys!"
"Who's ready to have some fun? :)"

[RoamingStrings]
"I spend way too much time looking at the scoreboard."
"The Phasing Zorcher is just too much fun."
"General Mills did a great job handling the Flemoid invasion."
"I like objective modes the best. Teamwork FTW!"
"Okay, I feel like $player_random_notself is following me right now."
"I wasn't patient enough for long-range training with zorchers."
"This is fun!"

[RareRoamingStrings]
"I always manage to get a little awkward around Will."
"Don't tell anyone, but I LOVE Chex(R) Mix!"

[FragStrings]
"Ooh, sweet!"
"I almost wasn't expecting that to work."
"That was a little too close for me."
"Nice try. ;)"
"Buh-bye, $player_killed."

[KilledStrings]
"That felt like it came out of nowhere."
"Aw, nice shot."
"Wow, good one, $player_killedby!"
"I tried so hard!"
"Better luck next time, I guess."

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"Oh, it's not over yet."
"I'm behind, but not for long!"
"$player_inlead isn't going to be leading much longer!"

[EnragedStrings]
"Was that necessary? I mean, really..."
"That wasn't very nice..."

[DemoralizedStrings]
"It's just not going my way today..."

[WinStrings]
"Yeah!"
"I don't know about you guys, but I had fun! :)"

[LoseStrings]
"That was a good match!"
"Let's go another round. I bet it won't end the same way. ;)"
