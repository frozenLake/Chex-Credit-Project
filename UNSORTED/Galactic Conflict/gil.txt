"Boy, it's been a long time since I've done this!"
"Back in the saddle again!"

[RoamingStrings]
"Back in my day, there was no such thing as a zorcher!"
"I used to be able to fly the fastest ships."
"General Mills and I were in the same division. He's a good man."
"I love watching strategy evolve in games like this."
"So apparently the Beam Zorcher is hot stuff, then?"
"If I could design a zorcher it'd look like the Phasing Zorcher."
"Gotta love a good bowl of vegetables!"
"This is much more fun than just sitting around, let me tell you."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"I kind of wish I was still on the frontlines, every once in a while..."

[FragStrings]
"Not bad for an old dog, huh?"
"Blast from the past!"
"That one worked back in my day, too!"
"That trick is so old it's new again!"

[KilledStrings]
"My eyesight's not what it used to be."
"I have no idea what just happened there."

"You're never too old to learn something new."

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"Either you guys are getting faster or I'm getting slower!"

[EnragedStrings]
"I don't get mad, I get even."

[DemoralizedStrings]
"$player_inlead might've even beat me when I was younger!"

[WinStrings]
"I guess I've still got it. ;)"
"Retirement never felt so good!"

[LoseStrings]
"Great match."
"I think I could actually handle another game."
