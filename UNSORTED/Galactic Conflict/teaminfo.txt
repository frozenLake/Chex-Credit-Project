// I was fully intending to use the teaminfo lump from the zandronum.pk3 file,
// except that the text colors aren't defined using hex code, so naturally the
// engine jacks them up when 'red' is used. It's green. Rarg. So the whole thing
// is here so that the red text shows up properly. Of course, this works
// everywhere except the bottom left of the HUD. Plus, I made the decision to
// forego support for multi-team games. Until Zandronum comes up with better
// control over multiplayer spawns, multi-team play on Chex Quest: Galactic
// Conflict will have to wait; I didn't want any maps to be unplayable in any of
// the game modes, so the compromise was to take out multiple teams.
