// He's always cookin' up trouble! It's everyone's favorite culinary wonder, The
// Chef from Chextropolis!

[IntroStrings]
"What's cookin'?"
"It's about to get spicy in here!"
"This is gonna be tasty!"
"Time to mix it up!"

[RoamingStrings]
"Something smells good in here!"
"Today's specials include Propulsor a la mode!"
"I'm as good with a zorcher as I am with a spatula!"
"A platoon is only as good as their cook."
"I need food for thought. Maybe literally."
"Time for a cook-off!"

[RareRoamingStrings]
"My sous chef is nowhere near as good a shot as me."
"In case you're wondering, the cooking puns are served well done with a healthy side of sarcasm."

[FragStrings]
"Your aim was a little... undercooked!"
"Should've left that in the oven a bit longer, $player_killed."
"I'm a seasoned veteran at this."
"A little more spice next time."
"Order up!"
"Icing on the cake."
"Don't be so salty!"
"Another happy customer."

[KilledStrings]
"Well done!"
"Out of the frying pan..."
"How'd you like to spend a day on the line, $player_killedby?"
"Well, deep fry me in carbonated chocolate sauce--good shot."
"Nothing's finer than being zorched by a diner."

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"Time to turn up the heat!"

[EnragedStrings]
"I'm about to boil over!"
"I'm about to be whipped into a frenzy!"

[DemoralizedStrings]
"I think I left something on the stove..."

[WinStrings]
"Can't take the heat? Get out of the kitchen!"
"You've been served!"

[LoseStrings]
"I'm beaten, but only for this game!"
"I'll find a way to whisk myself to the top of the leaderboard next match."
