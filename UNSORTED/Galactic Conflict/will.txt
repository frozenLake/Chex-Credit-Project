// Strong-minded, resourceful, and quick on his feet, Will learned everything

// He was chosen by the man himself to head the IFOC's outward expansion. He
// keeps his cards close to his chest and doesn't let his inner self show very
// often. He's had a crush on one of his squadmates since childhood. Cute!

"Let's do it!"
"Are you ready?"
"Let's rock 'n roll!"
"All right, let's go."

"I bet the Federation's happy now that things have calmed down."
"That new Beam Zorcher is a sweet bit of kit."
"Gotta love a fresh set of armor."
"One of these days I'm going to get my hands on my own LAZ Device."
"I like a bit of down-time, but action is more fun."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"Jet, was your father as bold as the sergeant major?"
"Jet, I thought the only lonely face was on the moon."
"I think the Chex(R) guy is secretly Chuck Norris in a giant waffle iron."

[FragStrings]
"Better luck next time!"
"I wasn't about to let you do that!"
"Score!"
"See ya!"

[KilledStrings]
"Nice shot."
"How'd you manage that?"
"I'll have to try that next time, $player_killedby."
"Ha, don't count on that working again."
"I was checking the scoreboard!"

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"I need to start practicing again."
"It's not over yet!"

[EnragedStrings]
"That's it--you're going down!"
"Oh, so that's how it is?"
"Okay, bring it on!"

[DemoralizedStrings]
"This has been a tough match."
"This has just been one of those days..."
"So, when does the next match start?"

[WinStrings]
"Booyah!"
"That's what I'm talking about! Yeah!"
"Awesome! That was tough."

[LoseStrings]
"Good game."
"Nice one!"
"Let's go another round, I've still got time."
