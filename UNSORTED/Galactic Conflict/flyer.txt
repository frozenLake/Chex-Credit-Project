[IntroStrings]
"Ready for takeoff?"
"Let's go!"
"Blast off!"

[RoamingStrings]
"I want to get away... I wanna fly away."
"Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies..."
"You wouldn't believe the ego on some of the Federation's best pilots."
"Flying through space is so liberating."
"Hold still and lemme zorch you!"
"Chex(R)ecutioner is just the dumbest map."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"Tongue tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I."

[FragStrings]
"Like a boss!"
"Nice try, $player_killed."
"Too late, game over, pal!"
"I feel the need for speed!"

[KilledStrings]
"I'll take the sky any day."
"That would've ended differently if we were in the air."
"Now, let's imagine that was a dogfight..."
"No way."
"I'm after you now, $player_killedby!"

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"Time for a little payback!"

[EnragedStrings]
"Oh, that is NOT happening."
"Come on, let's see it--I'm just getting started."
"Cut the chatter."

[DemoralizedStrings]
"I have been totally grounded this match."
"$player_inlead's gotta be cheating."

[WinStrings]
"Are you guys gonna play?"
"Yeah, that's what I like to see."

[LoseStrings]
"Good match, but next time, you're mine."
"My mind was somewhere else that game anyway."
"At least I did better than $player_lastplace."
