// Meet the world's biggest chemistry fangirl. Yes, those exist. Alkyl's father
// got her involved in the chemistry scene at a young age, and she was
// successfully identyifying compounds from NMR spectra by age 11. One of the
// Federation's brightest up-and-coming minds, she dreams of heading up one of
// its chemically-focused agencies.

"Zorch time!"
"Here we go!"
"Hey there. :)"

[RoamingStrings]
"You know, the Federation is hiring materials chemists right now."
"Fluorine is like that greedy friend who hogs all your cookies and never shares."
"I am so at home in a spectroscopy lab."
"So I've been working on this polymerization reaction with ethers..."
"Zusammen is just the cutest concept."
"Does a monomer propose to his bride with an aromatic ring?"
"I love the smell of an organic chemistry lab in the morning. Smells like... science!"
"I've never met two people who pronounce Le Chatelier's name the same way."
"Hydrides scare me."
"I hate helium. I have an awful helium voice because mine is already so high."
"Liquid nitrogen is so much fun."
"Anions form under basic conditions, cations form under acidic conditions."
"Anyone ever heard of octanitrocubane? No, I'm not making that up."
"I'm glad the Federation is pushing chemistry lately."
"The aldehyde is my favorite carbonyl."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"Don't tell anyone, but I started out studying Biology."
"Organic Chemistry is like the best thing ever, and people hate it when I say that."

[FragStrings]
"Like water in a Dean-Stark trap."
"See ya! :)"
"Any closer and I'd have been toast."
"Good try, $player_killed! :)"
"Now to catch up to $player_inlead."

[KilledStrings]
"That was like it was shot from a particle accelerator."
"Faster than an acid-base reaction! Wow, $player_killedby!"
"Aww, you caught me off-guard."
"That was a good shot!"

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"I'm not trying hard enough right now."
"Okay Alkyl, focus, focus!"

[EnragedStrings]
"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr."
"Don't make me go all E2 on you!"
"That's it--game on!"

[DemoralizedStrings]
"I think my chances of winning just evaporated."

[WinStrings]
"Woo! Thank you for playing. :)"
"That was more fun than I was expecting! :)"

[LoseStrings]
"We can go another round if you want."
"Good job! I'm happy for you. :)"
