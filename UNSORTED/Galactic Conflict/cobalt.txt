"Chex armor is not kind to people with long hair."
"I don't really play this game with a coherent strategy, haha."

"Is there a time limit on this thing?"

[FragStrings]
"That was beautiful!"
"I bet that wasn't as fun for you."
"Are you going to come back for more, $player_killed?"
"Surprised, $player_killed? :)"

[KilledStrings]
"Maybe it's time I take my headphones out."
"Oh, nice one!"
"Great shot!"
"I'll need to get a better zorcher for next time."
"Are you kidding me?"

"Man, I need to get back in the game."
"Am I reading the leaderboard incorrectly, or is $player_inlead actually winning?"

"That was fun, I guess."
"Good match!"
