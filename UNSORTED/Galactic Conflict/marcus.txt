"'Lo all."
"Ready to get zorched?"
"I'm ready. Come at me!"

[RoamingStrings]
"Anybody need a hyperdrive fixed? I haven't worked on one in forever."
"I was the guy who helped design the latest verison of the Rapid Zorcher, you know."
"There's a new version of the Rapid Zorcher on its way soon."
"I wanted to be a part of the team that built the Federation's latest starcruiser."
"How do you think the Federation would feel about a set of blueprints for a quantum-tunneling processor?"
"There's no way I'd go back to working as an analytics manager."
"The Mini Zorcher is actually a remarkable feat of engineering."
"The Bootspoon? Now that's an example of outside-the-box thinking."
"Do you have any idea how much power the LAZ Device consumes?"

[RareRoamingStrings]
"I admire the Beam Zorcher's designers, but they've got nothing on the guy who made the first zorchers."
"You know, Riley is a pretty special girl."

[FragStrings]
"Should've used a Rapid Zorcher. ;)"
"I'm surprised I managed that, actually."
"That was easier than I thought. No offense. ;)"
"Engineered to perfection."
"Try that again some time, $player_killed."
"Combat engineers FTW!"

[KilledStrings]
"I seem to have made an error in my calculations."
"That's what I get for dropping a significant figure."
"That was a little more than a math error."
"Nicely played!"

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"I need to stop designing zorchers in my head and get back in the game."
"I think that I need to make an adjustment to my opponents' skill coefficient."
"If you're not first, you're... not first."

[EnragedStrings]
"Okay, I did NOT misjudge that by that much."
"Somebody needs to check their upload speed..."

[DemoralizedStrings]
"If there's a solution to my issues this match, I can't find it."
"I just can't seem to crunch the numbers the right way today."
"Maybe I should take some lessons from $player_inlead."

[WinStrings]
"According to my calculations, I've finished first!"
"Nicely played everyone. That was fun!"

[LoseStrings]
"You know what they say about the best-laid plans..."
"I estimate that I have been bested!"
