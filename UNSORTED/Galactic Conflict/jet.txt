"How's everybody doing?"
"What's up, everyone?"
"I hope you guys didn't miss me too much. ;)"
"Hi, guys!"
"Green flag! :)"

[RoamingStrings]
"Did anybody catch the last F1 race?"
"I think it's about time for another track day."
"Zorchers make the strangest sounds."
"I can't wait for the 24 Hours of Le Mans."
"I know it's a cliche, but the Shipping Yard is probably my favorite map."
"The Indy 500 turns me into the worst fangirl."
"I'm still trying to find a ride... sponsorship is hard to come by."
"No way I'm not going to race this year. This year will be my year."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"I think Will likes the Beam Zorcher more than he likes me."
"I wonder what it takes to get through to Will sometimes."
"Racing is life. Everything before and after is just waiting."

[FragStrings]
"Bring it on!"
"Ooooooooh, gotcha!"
"Betcha didn't see that coming."
"Back in the game!"
"We'll have to do that again sometime. ;)"

[KilledStrings]
"Game on!"
"Is that any way to treat a lady?"
"You wanna take this out to the track?"
"You wanna try that again, $player_killedby?"
"Time for a fresh set of rubber..."
"Me, competitive? Whatever gave you that idea?"

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"It's okay--the only lap you have to lead is the last one."
"I hate losing. Especially to $player_inlead."

[EnragedStrings]
"That's it, you are SO toasted."
"Oh, COME ON!"
"Are you serious?"

[DemoralizedStrings]
"Well... darn."
"I'm not sure I can come back from this."
"This one's looking pretty much over."

[WinStrings]
"Checkered flag!"
"Thanks for playing. ;)"
"Well that was fun!"

[LoseStrings]
"Well, it's just one match."
"One more! One more!"
"I was off my game anyway."
"Congrats, $player_inlead."
