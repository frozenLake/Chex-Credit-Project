// E4M1 - Docking Bays: This is where it all started. I was sick one weekend and
// started faffing about with Doom Builder to pass the time. After two days,
// this was the result. Well, sort of; I got fed up with the wonky geometry and
// amateurish design of this level partway through working on E4M8 and went back
// to revise it. Believe me--even though it essentially has the exact same
// layout, the revision is far superior to the original. The rooms are bigger
// and properly proportioned, there's a lot more scenery to give you a better
// idea of what's going on, and it's a lot less linear than the original.
// Rebuilding it from scratch took me five hours--worth it, in my opinion. The
// original is on the game if you ever want to play it; just type 'Map E4MA'
// into the console, and you can play through all the old versions of the maps.
// You'd be amazed at how bad some of them are. The addition of the forcefields
// was almost an afterthought. I wanted to upgrade the design of the forcefield,
// but to be honest, the effect isn't the same without the hokey multi-colored
// laser beams. Towards the point at which I finished work on E4M7, I realized
// there was an exploit in the forcefield that allowed the player to sidle
// through it without losing too much health. I assumed that the forcefield
// property alone would be enough to prevent relatively unharmed passage, but I
// had to go back and add line-blocking flags to each of the forcefields to
// patch it--they only say that you need to do that in like, ten-thousand places
// on the ZDoom wiki, but don't worry, I know better. Romero says you should
// make your first level last, but if it weren't for this one this megawad
// wouldn't exist. Take that with a pinch of salt.

// E4M2 - Communications Array: Though its successors would become much larger
// and much more complex than this one, I still like the way this map came out.
// Decided from here that I was doing a nine-level episode, and started creating
// custom-made textures from existing graphics. One of my favorite bits on any
// of these levels is the air-duct adventure with the Flem Mines. Because ZDoom
// doesn't support the coding that prevents Flem Mines from fighting one another
// (found in Chex3.exe), I had to change them in 'Decorate' to stop them from
// damaging each other. It took four years, but I figured something out (check
// their decorate entry for my solution). The two rooms at the end after the
// elevator are also some of my favorites to play through, though the space
// effect took some time to get just right. It looks much better on GZDoom than
// it does in regular ZDoom, but that doesn't really surprise me. This one was
// another one that got the revision treatment, shortly after E4M1--all the
// rooms beheind the locked doors were formerly triangle-shaped computer rooms,
// and the doors led immediately into them. The geometry on the hexagon room was
// off, too, so I fixed that on the revision as well. And about the bridges--I
// do know how to use fake floors, but I like the look of the 'step' textures as
// catwalk-bridges and such better, so that's why I tended to use them more
// often than the fake floors.

// E4M3 - Teleport Hub: If you think this one is a pain to play, it was even
// more of a pain to make. It was a nightmare trying to keep track of the
// available tags and link all the teleports properly. And then there are those
// little things you do for variety, like putting each section of the base on
// its own plane in terms of z-height. I hate the closeness in proximity of all
// the rooms within the actual geometry of the map--for real they would be much
// farther apart--but I felt it would be too much work for very little benefit
// to spread the level out that much. I think the point is made that you're
// going to parts of the base that are far apart, anyway. I wanted to make the
// sections of the asteroid base visited in this level as diverse as possible,
// so I utilized familiar themes from prior Chex levels throughout this one to
// make each section feel like its own little mini-level--a concept I'd later
// revisit when working on the random level. As long as it is, I think it came
// out okay. The boss fight at the end took some time to code properly, and even
// more time in the form of modifying the battlefield so that there's no escape
// from the Flembrane's projectiles. You have no idea how weak that thing
// actually is as an enemy because of its lack of mobility. I love the way the
// fight itself came out, though. The 'challenge complete' fanfare from the
// 'Modern Warfare' series wasn't my first choice as boss victory fanfare, but I
// laughed so hard the first time I tried using it that I knew I wasn't going to
// be able to get rid of it. It remained as a place-holder sound-effect for
// boss victories right up until the very end of this project's development.
// The replacement just doesn't quite have the same effect, but I got used to it
// after a while. Years later (two, in fact), I decided to revisit this one and
// remove some of the linearity from it as I added in the bonus level. It took
// some time, but I feel it was worth it. The original progression is on the
// game as 'E4MD'. The old teleport directory wasn't colored and there weren't
// as many rooms; the revision adds some rooms and gives you two possible paths
// through the level that share the majority of the rooms, but winds up taking
// less time than the original. During the 'final push' for this project I went
// through and added 'clogged' teleports to some of the other levels to give a
// sense of continuity to the episode; I like the feel of interconnectedness it
// gives.

// E4M4 - Crewmen's Quarters: I had always fancied the idea of building a

// here. It was orginally going to consist of three pairs of barracks, but I
// felt the scenery would be a little repetitive by then (read: I got bored). As
// it stood, I was very, very tempted to make it so that you'd only have to go
// through one set of 'fighting' barracks and one set of 'stealth' barracks, but
// the progression works difficulty-wise, so I left it alone in the final cut.
// The entire premise of this level is based around one of the questions I
// always used to have when I played Chex Quest as a child: if the Bootspoon
// makes no sound at all when you use it on nothing, how does it alert Flemoids?
// At last, here, the Bootspoon actually has a purpose. I can die happy. Sure,
// it seems just a little cheesy that you're wandering through these huge swarms
// of Flemoids undetected just because you're using a spoon, but then again, did
// you really expect something more realistic, considering you're playing a game
// that actually allows you to use a -spoon- to defeat enemies in the first
// place? I think that pretty much sets the precedent for disbelief suspension
// here, to be perfectly hoenst with you. During my last revision of the game,
// around when I started working on the Command Hall, I decided to open up some
// of the earlier levels a little more--you originally didn't have a choice
// between fighting and stealth in the first set of barracks, but I thought it
// would be cool to give people that choice. In co-op, the level changes--you
// need to clear out each of the first pair of barracks to get to the next.
// This gives players an opportunity to split up. For a change.

// E4M6 - Technology Centre: I'm not kidding when I say I 'borrowed' a lot of
// ideas for this level. The door maze at the start is a discarded idea from an
// abandoned project; I didn't have a reliable method of solving it before but
// stumbled onto the light cues as the solution by accident while developing
// this level. The room with the hexagonal platforms was inspired by an early
// level in Jedi Outcast; oddly enough, it's unintentionally more annoying than
// the room that inspired it. The moving floors at the end were inspired by the
// force floors from Chip's Challenge; they don't move as quickly, but the
// effect is about the same. The name and appearance of the whole level was
// inspired by McLaren International's headquarters in Woking, 'Paragon Centre'.
// Heck, even one of the secret areas is basically right out of Super Mario 64.
// I wanted it to look like those freakishly-clean white rooms from most sci-fi
// movies, and duly fell in love with the white floor texture that I found as
// soon as I saw it. This one doesn't 'feel' to me like any of the other levels
// in the set, but in a good way, I think, and I like that. I tried going for
// the same 'feel' on E4M7, but I think I failed miserably there. Behind the
// Botanical Labs, this is probably my next favorite level--of all the little
// gimmicks on it, my favorite one is probably the sinking hallway at the end,
// though the pyramid stair-step contraption and the appearing bridges found in
// the Super Mario 64 secret area (a very late addition, actually) are a close
// second for me. The addition of the route to the bonus level was an
// afterthought, and required another secret area at the end; the air-duct
// corridor jump being too obvious, I settled on making a secret area within a
// secret area instead. I normally hate it when developers do gimmicks like
// that, but used sparingly I think they work, and I felt this was one of those
// times that it would. I also love the custom sign on the door leading to the
// power control room. This is also the level which introduces the Beam Zorcher.
// For almost the entirety of this project's development, I was using the
// sprites for the 'stolen' Phasing Zorcher from that other Chex Quest 3 as
// placeholders. My brother gets full credit for all of the artwork pertaining
// to the Beam Zorcher and he did a phenomenal job mimicking Charles Jacobi's
// artwork style; when his sprites wound up in the game during the last couple
// months I was working on it, I was duly blown away. I love it and think it's a
// perfect fit for the Chex Quest universe, and the original sprites being in
// the game gives a much better theatrical effect to the zorcher's introduction.

// E4M7 - Reactor Chambers: Oh man. This level. From start to finish, this one

// put things into perspective, finishing this level alone took me twice as long
// as it took me to finish the first six--including the time I spent revising
// the Docking Bays! I think you can find every map-making task I had ever
// needed to do from the first six levels on this single level, and then a few
// more, for good measure--new textures, new scenery, new projectiles, light
// colors, bridges, a boss fight, special enemies for the boss fight, and to
// quote the tragically late Phil Hartman, an 'ass-load' of ACS scripting. The
// nice part is that once I finished it, I never had to go back and fix anything
// on it. Unfortunately, the sad part is that I don't think it's really all that
// fun to play. I mean, it works, but it's probably the most tedious one in the
// set by far (maybe it's more exciting to play for a first-timer) and doesn't
// 'feel' like I think a Chex Quest level should. In the end, it was probably a
// huge waste of time, and I think I made things harder on myself than they
// needed to be when I made this one (and probably also made it longer than it
// needed to be), but hey, live and learn. I'd replace it with another level,
// but seriously, I invested so much time in it that letting it die would almost
// be unbearable--and I say that without a trace of affection whatsoever. It was
// inspired by the notorious Cairn Reactor level from Jedi Outcast. I really
// wanted to do something like that on ZDoom--Chex Quest, especially--but the
// moral of this story is that it either doesn't work with ZDoom or I just
// royally sucked at executing it. I get the feeling this level will probably
// have the same kind of notoriety in this episode that Cairn Reactor did in
// Jedi Outcast, too (I can almost hear the music from Cairn Reactor in my head
// each time I play it). Unintentional, but at least then it has something going
// for it, I suppose. Maybe it'll have some co-op value, but I have a feeling
// I'll probably have more fun frying my team-mates by switching the reactor
// beams on them than actually helping them. Don't ever play co-op with me, by

// E4M8 - Mining Tunnels: Originally, this one was going to be very different--
// the central room would have been like the 'Flemoid Nexus' that's in the final
// version, but much larger and with a pit of slime in the middle. The pit would
// have filled up as the player moved through the level, allowing access to new
// areas as it drew level with the player's starting floor. I canned the idea
// after the thought of how nightmarish it would be to script the filling of the
// many rooms connected to it and the potential implications that would have on
// co-op play. The only rooms leftover from the original map are the rooms at
// the start before the slime river and the large, dark, multi-level room near
// the yellow flemkey. I like the final version better than my original plan.
// After designing seven straight levels that all turned out far larger and
// longer than I had ever anticipated, I told myself to 'keep it short' for this
// one. As you can see, that was totally effective--so effective that I ended up
// making two levels in one, instead. I guess I can take solace in the fact that
// it has the shortest par time of any level since the Crewmen's Quarters, at
// least--but not by a very large amount, haha. This level's alternate path was
// inspired by both the 'Waterfalls' segment of the original 'Prince of Persia:
// The Sands of Time' and Banjo-Tooie's Glitter Gulch Mine, a level I still hate
// to this day. Fun fact: it uses theme textures from each of the three previous
// episodes' finale levels. Which honestly means nothing, because it's the next
// one where things really start boiling down to this episode's slimy
// conclusion, but I thought it was pretty cool anyway. This level also has
// what is probably my favorite secret area in the whole game, hidden in plain
// sight and inspired by one of my favorite movies. You'll feel awesome when you
// figure it out--if you're really stuck, pull down the console and type
// 'secret' for a clue from the movie that inspired it.

// E4M9 - Command Hall: I started this one and then put it on hold for about two
// years--the second big stall in this project after the reactor level. By the
// time I had come back, I was committed to more mapping masochism in the form
// of seven multiplayer maps/playability, co-op, and two additional bonus levels
// over the one I already had planned. Can you call it a 19-map 'megawad' if
// seven of those are made for multiplayer? 'Cause this thing feels like it fits
// the bill. Anyway, this is the last map in the main campaign. I suppose I
// should admit at this point that my first mapping experience in anything Doom-
// related was messing around with console commands in an early version of Chex
// Quest 3 to create harder versions of the levels in the game via use of the
// 'freeze' and 'summon' commands, an enormous amount of patience, and saving.
// These 'hard mode' levels involved about ten times as many Flemoids you'd find
// on the original level, occasional alternate routes and additional scenery,
// and cubic amounts of zorch recharges for you. At some point, they would all
// devolve into a blast-fest with the Phasing Zorcher. Egocentric as it may be,
// I really, really enjoyed playing through these; they were intense and
// fast-paced, and you felt like a demigod surviving so many enemies. Because I
// realize this sensation is only effective if utilized sparingly, I waited
// until the end of the game to deploy it; it seemed the most fitting place to
// unleash so many enemies. And so that's it: the design of this level closely
// resembles the saves from when my Doom-editing hobby was barely even
// infantile, bringing a nice cathartic circle-closing to a project that I feel
// I've been building up to for something like seven years. The objective is
// simple: load up on ammo, and don't let go of the button on that Phasing
// Zorcher. It's the Flemoids' last-ditch attempt to take over the cereal
// dimension, a surprise attack that's been building for eight long years--and
// now it all comes to a head right here, and you're leading the way.
//
// There's a lot to this level, and at this point I really thought I was
// beginning to exhaust my creativity with the use of the game's available
// textures. I suck as a graphic artist, so that's why there's barely any new
// textures in this game outside of recolors. My favorite part of this level is
// possibly the bit with space combat, because as far as I can tell it's pretty
// original. There's something very cinematic about how opening the door to the
// vacuum gives this oddly muted sound, and I -LOVE- that moment when you
// realize you're out in space fighting Flemoids--particularly since it was
// something I'd wanted to deploy since the beginning of the project and didn't
// get to do for four years. And it was completely intentional that this map has
// exactly 1000 Flemoids on the hardest difficulty; a nice round number.

// during the very final stage of this thing's development. And on that note,
// perhaps all-too fittingly for this particular bit, this was the final level I

// map created on the -third- computer involved in this project; the basic forms
// for E4M1-E4M8 were created on a 2007 Dell Vostro 1500; E4M9, Bonus 1-2,
// Multi 1-7, and all of the revisions to E4M1-E4M8 were performed on a 2013
// Dell Inspiron 15z; this level was created between OS X and a Windows
// partition of a 2016 MacBook Pro. I'm not sure if most wads get finished
// across multiple computers let alone multiple operating systems (or multiple
// operating systems on the same computer), but I still think it's pretty cool
// in retrospect that this project has followed me across so many computers.
// Anyway, the level isn't 'true' random, but I loved the name so it stuck. The 
// inspiration for this is yet another old video game: Super Mario World and the
// 'random' level on Choco Island. I'd say this functions similarly. Of all the
// levels in this project, this one put even the horror that is the reactor
// level to shame in terms of the amount of frustration and annoyance I went
// through in constructing it. I battled serious motivation issues to get this
// one finished because of multiple setbacks and frankly more experimentation
// with the scripts in the level than I'd ever dreamed I'd have to do. It was
// literally the last thing on the list to put an end to a four-and-a-half year
// Dooming odyssey. The nice part about it, though, is that I do think it's
// actually quite fun to play through, and I got to include almost every single
// concept from the proposed final episode for the sci-fi collaboration my
// brother and I worked on, albeit in a significantly abbreviated form. These
// ideas include the room with the lit pathway, the room that flips upside down,
// the ridge adventure on Bazoik, the spiral waterfall room, and the room with
// the monolithic block structure. The two ideas missing are the infinite-door
// maze on E4M6 and the flooded caves on E4M8. Kind of cool to have 'lived out'
// their creation at the very end, here. The upside down room is definitely a
// reference to Majora's Mask, in case you didn't catch it; Stone Tower is
// probably my favorite dungeon on any Zelda game. All in all, definitely owe

// MP01 - Shipping Yard: If you've played any FPS within the last ten years,

// to come out of the over-marketed Call of Duty series over to ZDoom. It's not
// an exact replica of Shipment, but that's intentional. I'm sure someone else
// has done a much more authentic remake--this one was only intended to bring
// Shipment to the world of Chex Quest, and to a greater extent, ZDoom. It only
// occurred to me years later that they basically ripped off fy_iceworld to make
// it, but, you know... it's CoD. What were you expecting?

// MP02 - Water Facility: N64 veterans will probably recognize this one--an
// homage to what may have been the greatest kart-racing game ever made. I

// on Icicle Pyramid when Diddy Kong Racing first came out. Whether or not the
// layout would hold up on other shooters, I don't know, but there's something
// about Doom's movement physics that made me feel like a port of Icicle Pyramid
// was a good idea. The outer spirals to the third floor were replaced with
// lifts instead--I'm not really sure you'd be able to properly recreate a
// correctly-sloped U-turn involving a fake floor without some coding that's far
// beyond my level, so the lifts will have to suffice. I think it's because of
// this map that I imagine all of my multiplayer maps having the "Battle Stage"
// music from Diddy Kong Racing playing on them. For some reason, that seems to
// fit with Chex Quest for me. Unfortunately the bots suck at this level because
// they can't seem to figure out how to use bridges or fake floors, so it's not
// really much fun unless you've got human opponents.

// I guess it's not that bad. The addition of powerups makes it distinctive from
// the other maps, I think. The room that was added in as in easter egg almost
// didn't happen--the next texture I saw after the Botticelli texture was the

// into the top nine. Fun stuff. Constructing outdoor or 'natural' areas has
// never been a favorite part of mine when building levels, so maybe that was

// in Chip's Challenge do--you move to the one closest to you in the direction
// you enter. I could've probably saved a lot of time by putting just one in the
// middle of each sector, but then it'd have been far too easy to warp around

// not quite, and I think that's okay. I still built it as part of the Training
// Range--that was always the plan--but the arrows on the floor are missing in
// this version and you can get to both of the balconies. I very nearly
// converted the desert training range into a map as well after testing this one
// for a bit--it was a blast to play in testing deathmatch against the bots.

// you get from trying to out-troll your friends. If Top Gear were to build a
// deathmatch map on Doom, this would be it. I don't think it's the concept of
// being able to send the rest of the match to their death that's so amusing in
// this one, but the manner in which it's done; flicking a switch and having
// everyone spontaneously die isn't very exciting--flicking a switch and
// watching your opponents get annihilated like the cement truck from
// Mythbusters is far more satisfying. There's a bit of ceremony to it--and
// that's basically what's at play here. As the Silent Walrus once profoundly
// suggested when asked to name the one certainty of the future: "We're all
