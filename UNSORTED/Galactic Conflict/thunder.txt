"Here comes chaos!"
"Helllloooooooo!"
"Everyone's favorite troublemaker is here!"

[RoamingStrings]
"Is there honestly anyone who actually likes the Beam Zorcher?"
"$player_random_notself, look behind you!"
"There wouldn't happen to be a LAZ Device on this map, would there?"
"Now wait a minute, didn't we just play this one?"
"It's a good thing I'm not a Flemoid."
"I have got the worst memory issues."
"The LAZ Device: now there's a balanced zorcher."
"Chex(R)ecutioner is the greatest thing ever."
"I hope we've got time for one more after this one."
"$player_inlead, I'm totally on low health right now and not waiting to zorch you at all."

[RareRoamingStrings]
"Breathe... breathe in the air."

[FragStrings]
"Score one for Thunder!"
"Fast as lightning, man."
"Could you make it a little harder next time?"
"Maybe you'll get me next time, $player_killed."
"I could've done that with a Bootspoon, too."

[KilledStrings]
"Oh, nice!"
"I won't be making that mistake again."
"Clearly I wasn't random enough."
"Lightning can apparently strike twice."
"Great shot, $player_killedby."
"You wouldn't have gotten away with that if I had a LAZ Device."

[LosingRoamingStrings]
"Has anyone looked at the scoreboard? I haven't."
"So apparently I'm not in first?"
"What do you mean, we're not playing Headquarters? That's not on this game?"
"We're scoring this based on who got fragged most, right?"

[EnragedStrings]
"Whatever."
"What? What? WHAT?"
"I just--how did you--I mean--I'm going to--WHAT?"
"RAGE."

[DemoralizedStrings]
"Where's the reset button? That seems like a good idea right now."

[WinStrings]
"BOOYAH."
"Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening!"

[LoseStrings]
"Great game, everyone."
"We're playing Chex(R)ecutioner next, right?"
